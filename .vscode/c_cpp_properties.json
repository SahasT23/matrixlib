// This file is used by VS Code to configure the C++ IntelliSense engine.
// It specifies the include paths, compiler settings, and other configurations needed for C++ development.
// The paths to Python and Pybind11 are included to ensure that the C++ code can
// interface correctly with Python, especially when using Pybind11 for binding C++ code to Python
